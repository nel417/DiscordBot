# DiscordBot
Discord Chatbot made with Discords bot documentation.<br>

if you type a message it will reply and give you the hang loose emoji.<br>
type !help and an argument and it will say what you need help with. (!help Ruby will say "It appears you need help with Ruby"<br>
if you type just !help it will reply with "I am not sure what you need help with. Try !help [topic]"<br>
type !multiply and 2 numbers and it will multiply them.<br>

The "playing" in the bots online area in your friends list is edited to say "with JavaScript" for "Playing with JavaScript"<br>

in source code where the XXXXXX are, put your information. the client.login(XXXXX) is where your key goes. to get your key go to Discord developer area and click on bot and you will see the generate key link(if you dont see it, create a new app, click the oauth to verify your app with your new server, and then your bot settings should show up.) The generalChannel client.channels.get(XXXX) is where your general text channels login goes. it will appear when you run the code in your terminal with node bot.js<br>
